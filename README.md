# Next-Word-Prediction-Project
Developed a ML based Algorithm that works as predictive keyboard to predict the upcoming word in a series of given words.Collected and preprocessed text data, including lemmatization, stemming, padding and tokenization. Implemented  a LSTM based neural network with 96% accuracy for sequence prediction optimized with Adam optimizer.
